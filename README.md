# The task is to predict the sales performance of several video games worldwide; to classify and cluster the video games based on some categorical variables.

The following questions were attempted;

a. Which of the variables in the video game dataset or a combination of them best predicts 
“global sales” of video games and why? Provide quantitative justifications for your answers.
b. What effect will the number of critics and users as well as their review scores have on 
the sales of Video games in North America, EU and Japan?
c. What propelled the choice of your regressor for this task? Aptly discuss with 
quantitative reasons! 
d. Use all the relevant categorical variables in the Video Game Dataset as the target 
variable at each instance and determine which of the variables performed best in 
classifying the dataset. Explain your findings. 
e. How did you check whether your models did not overfit?
f. Can your classification models be deployed in practice based on their performances? 
Explain. 
g. In the video game dataset, use a relevant categorical variable and other relevant non_categorical variables to form groups at each instance. By employing internal and 
external evaluation metrics, determine which categorical variable best describes the 
groups formed.
